# PROJECT NO LONGER SUPPORTED

Please do not use this. It is not maintained nor have I attempted to maintain it in years. This version does have known vulnerabilities as a result of some experimental functionality that did not pass the test of time (https://speakerdeck.com/skepticfx/js-suicide-using-javascripts-security-features-to-kill-itself). Please go here instead: https://github.com/aramrami/OWASP-CSRFGuard
